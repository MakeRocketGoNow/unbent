# Unbent

A personal note app that keeps your notes in Markdown and hands them back whenever you ask.

Notes are Markdown with YAML frontmatter. Attachments are ordinary files. Export produces a
plain folder tree — one directory per note, containing `note.md` and a `files/` subdirectory —
that you can read, grep, and back up without this app existing.

## Why

Evernote's owner gave a lot of people a reason to leave. Leaving should be easy, and staying
should never depend on it being hard.

## Stack

- **Cloudflare Pages** — SPA hosting
- **Cloudflare Workers** + Hono — API
- **Cloudflare D1** (SQLite) — note text, metadata, FTS5 full-text search
- **Cloudflare R2** — attachment blobs
- **Better Auth** — OAuth (Google, GitHub)
- **Vite + React + CodeMirror 6** — Markdown editor with live preview

Workers Paid ($5/mo) is required: the free tier's 10ms CPU limit cannot run import or export.

## Layout

```
apps/web       Vite + React SPA
apps/api       Hono API on Workers
packages/shared  zod schemas, frontmatter codec, remark plugins
packages/enex    ENEX -> Markdown, runtime-agnostic
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
cp apps/api/.dev.vars.example apps/api/.dev.vars   # then set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
pnpm migrate:local
pnpm dev
```

The SPA runs on :5173 and proxies `/api/*` to the Worker on :8787, so sessions are same-origin
and there is no CORS in development.

## Auth

Better Auth with OAuth only — Google and GitHub. A provider without configured credentials
is simply not offered, so local development works with none of them set.

Sessions are cookie-based and same-origin. Better Auth enforces CSRF by requiring a trusted
`Origin`, so API clients outside the browser must send one.

## Tenant isolation

D1 has no row-level security, so isolation is application code and nothing else. Data access
goes through the scoped repos in `apps/api/src/lib/repo.ts`, which take the user id as a
constructor argument — route handlers never touch `env.DB` directly, so an unscoped query is
not expressible. `apps/api/test/isolation.test.ts` asserts this and grows with every phase
that adds a route touching user data.

## Backups and export

`GET /api/export` streams a zip of the whole account as a plain folder tree:

```
first-note-2382e420/note.md
untitled-e080eb5b/note.md
```

Each `note.md` is markdown with YAML frontmatter (id, title, created, updated, tags). The
directory name is a slug plus an id fragment, so two notes with the same title do not
collide. Standard `unzip` reads it; no part of this app is needed to get your notes back.

This is the backup mechanism, not a convenience feature: `wrangler d1 export` fails on any
database containing an FTS5 table and leaves the database wedged in a "processing export"
state ([workers-sdk#9519](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/9519)). Do not
run it.
